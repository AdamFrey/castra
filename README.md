# Castra

Web application RPC library for Clojure/Script and Ring.

## Installation

Artifacts are published on Clojars.

[](dependency)
```clojure
[hoplon/castra "3.0.0-alpha1"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

## Usage

Castra uses Cognitect's Transit library to serialize and deserialize EDN as JSON, giving a transparent
feel for calling remote functions and abstracting the HTTP layer away at the same time.

## Examples

The [Hoplon Demos][1] repo contains demo apps using Castra.
