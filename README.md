# Castra

Web application RPC library for Clojure/Script and Ring.

## Installation

Artifacts are published on Clojars.

[![latest version][3]][1]

## Usage

Castra uses Cognitect's Transit library to serialize and deserialize EDN as JSON, giving a transparent
feel for calling remote functions and abstracting the HTTP layer away at the same time.

## Examples

The [Hoplon Demos][2] repo contains demo apps using Castra.
